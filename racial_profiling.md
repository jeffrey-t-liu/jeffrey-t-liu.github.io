        Facing Gaia: Eight Lectures on the New Climatic Regime
      </a>
    </h6>
    <small>
      by <em>Bruno Latour</em> (2017)
      <br/>
      This book is based on a series of lectures where Latour engages with the figure of Gaia — drawn from the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock — which proposes that the Earth is a self-regulating, living system. However, Latour strips Gaia of any mystical or harmonious connotations, instead portraying it as a volatile, unpredictable force that defies human control.
